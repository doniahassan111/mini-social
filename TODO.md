# Mini Social Project - Layout Refactoring

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated app.blade.php to use @yield('content') instead of hardcoded content
- [x] Removed all hardcoded posts and static content from the layout
- [x] Maintained the header, sidebar, and navigation structure
- [x] Preserved all CSS styles and JavaScript functionality
- [x] Created resources/views/home.blade.php with all homepage content
- [x] Verified all existing view files already extend the new layout correctly:
  - [x] resources/views/posts.blade.php - Already extends layouts.app
  - [x] resources/views/profile.blade.php - Already extends layouts.app
  - [x] resources/views/search.blade.php - Already extends layouts.app
  - [x] resources/views/notifications.blade.php - Already extends layouts.app
  - [x] resources/views/settings.blade.php - Already extends layouts.app

## Next Steps
- [ ] Update routes to use the new view structure (if needed)
- [ ] Test the layout with different content sections
- [ ] Ensure all functionality (sidebar, dark mode, etc.) still works correctly
